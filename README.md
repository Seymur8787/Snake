Snake Game (C++ Console Version)
This is my first experience with game development. I'm learning C++ and created a simple Snake game in the console as a training project.
The goal of this project is to improve my programming skills and practice writing real working code.

Features:
Snake movement and keyboard input

Randomly spawning fruit

Growing tail after eating fruit

Score tracking

Collision detection (walls and self)

Technologies:
Language: C++

Console-based (no graphics library)

Uses standard C++ and Windows-specific functions (conio.h, windows.h)
